        <h1>About In2It</h1>

        <p>The In2It team is an interdisciplinary group of tech-oriented Chicagoans who think that civic involvement matters. A survey of our fellow Chicagoans found that there is a sizeable group that wants to be civically engaged, but faces obstacles to doing so. We want to make it easier for people to get involved in their communities.</p>


        <h2>Values</h2>
        <ul> 
            <li><b>Accessibility</b> - available and useable by anyone</li>
            <li><b>Inclusivity</b> - “an atmosphere in which all people feel valued and respected and have access to the same opportunities”</li>
            <li><b>Transparency</b> - explaining in clear and detailed terms our operating practices pertaining to the end user; we will notify you of changes; we pledge to be transparent in our data and privacy policies.</li>
            <li><b>Civic Engagement</b> - purposeful action by an individual and/or group intended to have a positive impact within a community</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Vision</h2>

        <p>To be the primary resource helping every Chicagoan be more civically engaged in their neighborhoods, that is…</p>
